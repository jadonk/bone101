     <h1>Software Updates</h1>
     <p>There are multiple ways to run initial software on your board, but
      it is likley that the simplest way to get an update is to create an
      exact replica of a bootable microSD card and boot off of it.  The
      BeagleBone Black Rev C has 4GB of eMMC storage (2GB on previous revisions)
      that can be initialized by
      a program booted off of a microSD card.  If you want to update to the
      latest software image for your board, this is a way to do that.</p>

    <h2>Step #1: Download the latest microSD card image</h2>
    <p>Download "Angstrom Distribution" from <a target="_blank" href="http://beagleboard.org/latest-images">http://beagleboard.org/latest-images</a>.</p>
    <p><small><b>Note:</b>&nbsp;Due to sizing necessities, this download may take 30 minutes or more.</small></p>
    <p>The Angstrom Distribution ships with the boards. The file you download will have an .img.xz extention. This is a compressed sector-by-sector image of the SD card.</p>

    <h2>Step #2: Install compression utility</h2>
    <p>Download and install <a target="_blank" href="http://www.7-zip.org/download.html">7-zip</a>.</p>

    <h2>Step #3: Decompress the image</h2>
    <p>Use 7-zip to decompress the SD card .img file</p>

    <h2>Step #4: Install SD card programming utility</h2>
    <p>Download and install <a target="_blank" href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/win32diskimager/files/latest/download">Image Writer for Windows</a>. Be sure to download the binary distribution.</p>

    <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/static/images/extract-win32diskimager.png" width="50%" /><br />
    <p>Some general help on programming SD cards can be found on the <a target="_blank" href="http://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/FromImgFiles">Ubuntu Image Writer page</a>. 

    <h2>Step #5: Connect SD card to your computer</h2>
    <p>Use the provided microSD card to SD adapter or a USB adapter to connect the SD card to your computer.</p>

    <h2>Step #6: Write the image to your SD card</h2>
    <p>Use either the Ubuntu Image Writer or instructions on its page to write the decompressed image to your SD card.</p>

    <h2>Step #7: Eject the SD card</h2>
    <p>Eject the newly programmed SD card.</p>

    <h2>Step #8: Boot your board off of the SD card</h2>
    <p>Insert SD card into your (powered-down) board, hold down the USER/BOOT button (if using Black) and apply power, either by the USB cable or 5V adapter.</p>
    <p>If using an original white BeagleBone, you are done.</p>
    <p>If using BeagleBone Black and the image is meant to program your on-board eMMC, you'll need to wait while the programming occurs.  When the flashing is complete, all 4 USRx LEDs will be lit solid.</p>
    <p><b>Note</b>:&nbsp;<em>This can take up to 45 minutes.</em></p>
    <p>Power-down your board, remove the SD card and apply power again to be complete.</p>
