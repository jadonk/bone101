	  	<p>The <a href="http://www.maxbotix.com/Ultrasonic_Sensors/MB1020.htm">LV-MaxSonar-EZ2 High Performance Sonar Range Finder</a> provides very short
		to long-range detection</br>and ranging, in an incredibly small package. The sonar
		detects objects from 0-254 inches and provides sonar</br>range information from 6-inches
		out to 254-inches with 1-inch resolution.
		</p>
		<i>Note: Each time after the Sonar is powered up, it will calibrate
		during its first read cycle. The sensor uses this stored</br>
		information to range a near object. It is important that objects
		not be close to the sensor during this calibration cycle.</br>The
		best sensitivity is obtained when it is clear for fourteen 
		inches, but good results are common when clear for at least</br>s		seven inches. If an object is too bear the Sonar during the calibration
		cycle, the sensor may then ignore the objects at</br>that distance.
		To calibrate the LV-MAX Sonar, cycle power then command a read
		cycle.</i><br><br>

		The AN pin outputs a voltage with a scaling factor of (V<sub>cc</sub>/512) per inch. Since the AIN pin has a maximum voltage</br>capacity of 1.8V, we will set a voltage divider to account for that difference. With the voltage divider, a supply of</br>5V yields ~6.99mV/in. and 3.3V yields ~4.57mV/in.

		<h2>Build and execute instructions</h2>
		<ul>
		 <li>Connect the "GND" pin from the sensor to P9_1 of the board</li>
		 <li>Connect the "+5" pin from the sensor to P9_3 of the board</li>
		 <li>Connect the 1.2kohm resistor to the AN pin of the supersonic sensor.</li>
		 <li>Connect the 3k ohm resistor in series with the 1.2k ohm resistor and tie the bottom to ground, as shown in the diagram.</li>
		 <li>Connect P9_40 of BeagleBone in series with the 3k ohm and 1.k ohm resistor.</li>
		 <li>Click "Run" on the code and it will output the distance, in inches, that the
		 sensor is detecting... updating every 5 seconds</li>
		 <li>Move the sensor nearer to or farther from an object to see the change in distance</li>
		</ul>
